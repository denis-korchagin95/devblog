# Dev Blog

This repository contains the source code for my personal blog, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The blog focuses primarily on **software development**, with occasional posts about **psychology** and **workplace dynamics**.
